# Senior-Security-Consultant-Interviewing-Chief-Technology-Officer



I played the part and had to write an essay about me playing the role as a senior security consultant who is interviewing a chief technology officer about a company's cyber security problems and other topics related to cyber security, and had to give suggestions to the CTO on what cyber security measures to enforce, explain the concepts of cyber security, preventative measures to take in order prevent any more cyber attacks, and explain the consequences of any cyber attacks.
